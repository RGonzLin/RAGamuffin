# Ham Croquettes

## Ingredients
- 200 g of Serrano ham
- 1 scallion
- 1 clove of garlic
- 100 g of flour
- 100 g of butter (or 100 ml of extra virgin olive oil)
- 1 liter of milk
- Parsley
- Flour (for coating)
- 3 beaten eggs
- Bread crumbs
- Extra virgin olive oil (for frying)

## Instructions
1. First, cut the butter into cubes and melt it in a saucepan over heat.
2. Finely chop the scallion and garlic clove and add them to the saucepan. Sauté everything for 5-6 minutes.
3. Then add the chopped ham and sauté it.
4. Once the ham is cooked, add the flour and sauté for a couple of minutes to cook the flour through.
5. Gradually pour in the milk, stirring constantly.
6. Cook the béchamel sauce for about 20 minutes, stirring continuously. When done, sprinkle with chopped parsley and mix.
7. Spread the mixture onto a platter. Butter the surface to prevent a crust from forming, or cover with plastic wrap and let it cool completely (it can be left overnight in the refrigerator).
8. Once the mixture is cold, cut or take small portions and shape them into your preferred croquette shape: rectangular, oval, square, round, etc.
9. Prepare three plates: one with flour, one with the beaten eggs, and another with breadcrumbs. Coat the croquettes first in flour, then dip them in egg, and finally cover them with breadcrumbs.
10. Fry the croquettes in a pot or skillet with plenty of hot olive oil, making sure they brown on all sides.
11. Once cooked, remove the croquettes from the skillet and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
12. Serve the ham croquettes immediately to maintain their texture.
